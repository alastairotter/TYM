       <p>This is the start of the <strong>Track Your Mayor</strong> admin interface.</p> 
       
       <p>Some of the functionality is not yet working.</p>
       
       <p>What is and isn't working:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Under the <strong>List</strong> menu item you can view the various data fields including <em>mayors, municipalities, parties</em>, and <em>promises</em></li>
        <li>In the <strong>List View</strong> you can sort the columns by <strong>clicking on the column headers</strong>.</li>
        <li>A basic <strong>filter</strong> is available in <strong>List View</strong>. Type to automatically filter.</li>
        <li>You can add new elements from the <strong>List View</strong> or via the <strong>Add</strong> menu itme.
        <li>Existing records can't be edited yet. This will be added shortly. </li>
        <li>The <strong>Test Home</strong> page is just a sample of various ways we can pull out the data and display it. Still very rough.</li>
